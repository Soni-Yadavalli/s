                <p>I don't love you because you are perfect,<br>
                or because you say the right things,<br>
                or because you make the world little easier to bear.<br>
                I LOVE YOU because my heart chose you quitely without any reason.<br>
                It's not something I planned,<br>
                not something I could stop even If i tried,<br>
                It just chose you.<br>
                I love you when you smile,<br>
                But also when you don't.<br>
                I love you in silence,in distance, in spaces where the woods can't reach.<br>
                You ask me "WHY ME?"<br>
                And I could list thousand small things,<br>
                but none of them would be true because,<br>
                LOVE doesnot need any reason,<br>
                It just is!<br>
                So if you ever doubt it, remeber this:<br>
                I may not know how much I LOVE YOU<br>
                But I know I LOVE YOU beyond anything,<br>
                Beyond any reason, <br>
                Beyond time,<br>
                Beyond even MYSELF!<br></p>
                <br>
